# Library_Managment


In this case study, you will learn how to implement the principles of object-oriented programming by building a simple library management system. The system will allow users to add, view, and manage books in a library. The library management system will have the following functionality:

1.Users can add books to the library.<br/>
2.Users can view a list of books in the library.<br/>
3.Users can search for a book by title, author, or ISBN.<br/>
4.Users can remove a book from the library.<br/>
5.User can filter the books that are issued to students.<br/>
6.User can filter the books by authors.<br/>

The system will be designed using the following classes: Book: Represents a book in the library. Books can have different genres such as Fiction, Philosophy, Religion and each of this type have different attributes and behaviors. 

The base class will have properties such as title, author, and ISBN, and methods for adding and removing a book. Properties of this class can be extended as per your own understanding of the problem. Library: Represents the library. This class will have methods for adding a book, removing a book, and searching for a book by multiple parameters. Student: Represents the readers of the books. This class will have methods to acquire a book, return a book, and view catalog by genre of his choice. Author: Represents the writer of the books. This class will have methods to submit a book, withdraw a book. The system will be implemented using object-oriented programming constructs required to implement the Book, Library, Author, and Student classes and use them to create objects.
